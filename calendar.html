COP30 Consultation Outline**\n\nAt our gathering, we will join together with families to think deeply about some big questions connected to COP30 (the United Nations Climate Change Conference) and how we can build a more sustainable, fair, and united world. Each junior youth will join a small group with adults to explore one question through *consultation*.\n1. **Opening**\n\n   * Welcome, short introduction about COP30 and why young people?s voices matter.\n   * A reminder about the spirit of consultation: everyone?s ideas are valuable, we listen with respect, and we look for truth together. (Aaron to open)\n\n2. **Small Group Discussions**\n   Each group will focus on **one of the five questions** below. You don?t need to be an expert ? just bring your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. (Talina, Elodie, Rohan and Aaron each take a group)\n\n   **The questions are:**\n\n   1. Why do people sometimes ignore science or traditional knowledge about the climate, or share misinformation, even though lives are at risk? *(Talinas group^^)*\n\n\n   2. Why do we keep producing and consuming in ways that hurt the vulnerable and ignore the 1.5?C goal?\n*(Elodies group ^^) *\n\n   3. What can be done so that rich countries and fossil fuel companies speed up their transition and help finance changes in vulnerable countries?\n*( Rohans group ^^)*\n\n   4. What traditions, histories, or cultural/spiritual practices from your community teach us to live in greater harmony with nature?\n*(Aaron?s group ^^)*\n\n   5. How can we bring more people, leaders, companies, and nations into this movement for just and ethical climate action? What ideas and values could inspire us?\n*Optional question if groups have time*\n\n   **During your group time:**\n\n   * Read the question slowly together.\n   * Take turns sharing your first thoughts.\n   * Ask each other follow-up questions.\n   * Look for common themes or ideas.\n   * Note down key points to share back.\n\n3. **Sharing Back**\n\n   * Each group will choose one junior youth to summarize the main ideas from their consultation.\n   * We will listen to all groups and notice connections between what was shared.\n\n4. **Closing**\n\n   * Reflect on what inspired us most.\n   * Share one action (big or small) we can take as families and as a community.\n\n### Tips for Junior Youth\n\n* Speak from the heart, don?t worry about ?right? answers.\n* Be curious ? ask questions about what others share.\n* Remember: consultation means listening, respecting, and searching for truth together.\n\nTogether, our voices and ideas can help shape a more sustainable and just future!22 ","singleDate":"2025-10-04"},{"timestamp":"2025-09-13T05:39:36.461Z","eventName":"Convo with CC parents ","eventType":"Social Action","regularOrExpansion":"Special activity for expansion","eventDates":"Sun Oct 05 2025 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)","eventTime":"Afternoon","contact":"Donna","location":"Perkins? home ","description":"Conversations with CC parents to become protagonists ","openToAnyone":"Limited capacity, please contact","reflection":"","singleDate":"2025-10-05"},{"timestamp":"2025-09-13T09:06:48.318Z","eventName":"Expansion Reflections","eventType":"Other 1","regularOrExpansion":"Special activity for expansion","eventDates":"Sun Oct 05 2025 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)","eventTime":"Morning","contact":"ATC","location":"TBA","description":"Space to reflect on the Expansion activities and efficacy of a calendar and no school this cycle ","openToAnyone":"Open","reflection":"Do we need a reflection of the expansion phase itself.
